        Love Our Earth Sustainability Series
      </h3>
      <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="flex-item-portraits">
          At Wallis Annenberg GenSpace, I proposed, conceptualized, and taught a three-class series titled 
          <em>Love Our Earth</em>. This class was designed to empower GenSpace members in learning more about 
          why being a climate-friendly ally is important in navigating the specific impact our world’s changes 
          have on older adults. I also designed the course with the intent of discussing how we can strengthen our eco-friendly 
          habits, how we can protect themselves in the face of climate change, and how we can connect with nature in 
          different ways. Covering sustainable lifestyles, eco-friendly habits, and the intersection of climate change 
          and aging, <em>Love Our Earth</em> used original presentations, discussions, and interactive activities to engage 
          members in fostering their connections with sustainability.

          Below you can find the Love Our Earth Sustainability Series Impact Report, which provides a recap of the course, 
          statistics from feedback forms, and future sustainability programming ideas for Wallis Annenberg GenSpace. 
          This report is intended to provide senior leadership a greater insight into intern programs.

        All members at GenSpace consent to being photographed around the space for purposes, like these impact reports, 
        as well as social media. While original images were provided to senior leadership, I covered visible faces 
        out of respect to the privacy of members.

        Reimagining the “Senior Center” as a Public Health Initiative: 
        A Wallis Annenberg GenSpace Case Study
      </h3>
      <p>
        For my Advanced Writing course, my professor tasked our class with 
        writing a focused research argument that utilizes both primary and secondary 
        research on one specific topic of choice. Given my interests in community centers to 
        aid in aging in place, I chose to write about my current place of employment, Wallis 
        Annenberg GenSpace, and why we should begin to think of senior centers as sources to 
        execute public health initiatives. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I conducted 10 interviews with staff and members as primary research, which builds the foundation 
        of the paper. I also composed an annotated bibliography for this paper.

      <h2>Sexual Rights for Social Change Academy</h2>
      <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="flex-item-portraits">
          <p>
            During my time as a fellow for the USC Institute on Inequalities in Global Health's 2024 Sexual 
            Rights for Social Change Academy, I created 12 short-form videos on social media about reproductive justice, comprehensive 
            sex education, censorship, and HIV stigma. By conducting independent research, storyboarding, and utilizing popular filming 
            techniques, I was able to make space for discussions on taboo topics in a fun, engaging way.
    
            For my capstone project, I presented a mock campaign titled, “Expanding Medicaid Access in Florida for Sexual Health 
            Services,” that featured 1 short-form video and persuasive speech. I wanted to make my capstone about health insurance, 
            because of my gerontology background. Florida is one of 10 states that has not yet expanded Medicaid, so this topic resonates 
            with me, as I firmly believe my peers should have access to these critical services.
    
            Below is the final edited video, which USC IIGH staff approved for the showcase.
